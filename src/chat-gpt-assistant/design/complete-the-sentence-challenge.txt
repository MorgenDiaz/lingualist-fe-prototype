"complete the sentence screen"
The "complete the sentence" screen consists of a sentence with a blank space for the user to fill in with the correct vocabulary word.
The sentence is generated randomly based on a vocabulary word chosen from a list of 8 randomly selected words from the user's vocabulary list.
The user types in their answer and can submit it for evaluation.
If the user is correct, they are taken to the "complete the sentence challenge result" screen with a success message displayed at the top.
If the user is incorrect, they can try again or skip the challenge.
There is also an "I'm stuck" button which takes the user to a screen displaying the correct vocabulary word,
its definition, and a button to hear the pronunciation of the word.

"Complete the Sentence Result" Screen:
The "Complete the Sentence Challenge Result" screen is displayed after the user has completed the "Complete the Sentence" challenge.
It displays the result of the challenge, either a success message if the user completed the challenge successfully
or the correct vocabulary word if the user chose to skip the challenge.
The screen also includes the definition of the word and a button to hear the pronunciation of the word.
The user can play the challenge again or return to the main menu.
